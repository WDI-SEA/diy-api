Greek Mythology API

Steps:
1) create a model for the pantheon gods with their attributes as; name, img_url, and associations
2) Write routes to show all gods, add a god, show more details for one god, update a god's info, or delete a god 
    2a) create a controller file to keep track of the "/gods" url 
    2b) layouts.ejs should have a home page layout showing all gods and have clickable links to; edit a god, add a new god, and delete a god if needed
    2c) create a detail.ejs forEach god that shows more information on them
3) make sure I have a database where everything is being stored.
